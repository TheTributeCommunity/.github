# Welcome to Tribute!ü§ù

Tribute is a platform that **connects incredible talent with real projects** that help building a **better world**.

Today there are a large number of NGOs with technological challenges that don't allow them to develop their activity and achieve their objectives. Due to their nature, they are not able to finance the associated technical costs, thus leaving tasks to be carried out.
On the other hand, there is a large community of developers that would like to contribute altruistically in open source projects. 

And not only developers, there are many professionals from different sectors who could contribute part of their knowledge. But the effort is too high as projects are not easy to contribute to.

The success relies on organizing and structuring these challenges into actionable tasks that can be easy to contribute to.
That is our **goal**: to search for and structure the technological needs of projects with a positive impact in our societies and connect people willing to collaborate to move them forward. 


And that is Tribute, a tribute for those projects willing to change the world, a **tribute to you that are here willing to contribute.**



**Welcome to Tribute!**
